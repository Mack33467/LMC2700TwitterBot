# LMC2700TwitterBot
This bot originated as a project for my class LMC2700: Introduction to Computational Media\n
Hopefully now it can serve as an example of how to make a basic twitter bot/ how to format\n
Twitter's API request

The bot is still running at this page:https://twitter.com/CraftGoodVibes \n
All the code for a functional bot is present in the files provided here, but you need an\n
API key from https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en.html \n
Setting up Twitter's developer environment can be kind of a hassel, so be sure to provide\n
as much info as you can when first applying. Be sure to have a clear intention for your bot\n
as the better you understand what you want to do, the easier it will be to get the twitter\n
access that you want.
